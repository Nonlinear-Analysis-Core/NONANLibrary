function [tau,v_AMI]=AMI_Stergiou(data,L,varargin)

% [tau,v_AMI]=AMI(data,L,bins)
% inputs    - data, column oriented time series
%           - L, maximal lag to which AMI will be calculated
%           - bins, number of bins to use in the calculation, if empty an
%             addaptive formula will be used
% outputs   - tau, first minimum in the AMI vs lag plot
%           - v_AMI, vector of AMI values and associated lags
% Remarks
% - This code uses average mutual information to find an appropriate lag
%   with which to perform phase space reconstruction. It is based on a
%   histogram method of calculating AMI.
% - In the case a value of tau could not be found before L the code will
%   automatically re-execute with a higher value of L, and will continue to
%   re-execute up to a ceiling value of L.
% - The sparse function was historically used in this code to calculate the
%   probability distribution of the numbers in the time series.
% - There are some cases where a weakly periodic time series will not have
%   a clear first minimum and the code will return unsatisfactory results.
%   For these cases the last row of v_AMI contains the time lag at 1/5 the
%   original AMI. The best way to confirm this choice is to lot the AMI
%   verses the time lag. (Abarbanel et al. 1993)
% Future Work
% - None currently.

%          - Modified code to output a plot and notify the user if a value
%            of tau could not be found.

%          - Previously the number of bins was hard coded at 128. This
%            created a large amount of error in calculated AMI value and
%            vastly decreased the sensitivity of the calculation to changes
%            in lag. The number of bins was replaced with an adaptive
%            formula well known in statistics. (Scott 1979
%          - The previous plot output was removed.

%          - In cases where L was not high enough to find a minimun the
%            code would reexecute with a higher L, and the binned data.
%            This second part is incorrect and was corrected by using
%            data2.
%          - The reexecution part did not have the correct input
%            parameters.
