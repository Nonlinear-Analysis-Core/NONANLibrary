  function SE = Ent_Samp20200723(data,m,r)
  SE = Ent_Samp20200723(data,m,R) Returns the sample entropy value.
  inputs - data, single column time seres
          - m, length of vectors to be compared
          - r, radius for accepting matches (as a proportion of the
            standard deviation)

  output - SE, sample entropy
  Remarks
  - This code finds the sample entropy of a data series using the method
    described by - Richman, J.S., Moorman, J.R., 2000. "Physiological
    time-series analysis using approximate entropy and sample entropy."
    Am. J. Physiol. Heart Circ. Physiol. 278, H2039â€“H2049.
  - m is generally recommendation as 2
  - R is generally recommendation as 0.2
  May 2016 - Modified by John McCamley, unonbcf@unomaha.edu
           - This is a faster version of the previous code.
  May 2019 - Modified by Will Denton
           - Added code to check version number in relation to a server
             and to automatically update the code.
  Jul 2020 - Modified by Ben Senderling, bmchnonan@unomaha.edu
           - Removed the code that automatically checks for updates and
             keeps a version history.
