function SE = Ent_Samp(data,m,R)% SE = Ent_Samp20200723(data,m,R) Returns the sample entropy value.% inputs - data, single column time seres%        - m, length of vectors to be compared%        - R, radius for accepting matches (as a proportion of the%          standard deviation)%% output - SE, sample entropy% Remarks% - This code finds the sample entropy of a data series using the method%   described by - Richman, J.S., Moorman, J.R., 2000. "Physiological%   time-series analysis using approximate entropy and sample entropy."%   Am. J. Physiol. Heart Circ. Physiol. 278, H2039–H2049.% May 2016 - Modified by John McCamley, unonbcf@unomaha.edu%          - This is a faster version of the previous code.% May 2019 - Modified by Will Denton%          - Added code to check version number in relation to a server%            and to automatically update the code.% Jul 2020 - Modified by Ben Senderling, bmchnonan@unomaha.edu%          - Removed the code that automatically checks for updates and%            keeps a version history.% Define r as R times the standard deviation% Copyright 2020 Nonlinear Analysis Core, Center for Human Movement% Variability, University of Nebraska at Omaha%% Redistribution and use in source and binary forms, with or without % modification, are permitted provided that the following conditions are % met:%% 1.
