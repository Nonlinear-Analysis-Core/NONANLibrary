function [rho,out]=Surr_findrho(y,tau,dim)
% rho=Surr_findrho20200626(y,tau,dim)
% inputs  - y, time series
%         - tau, time lag for phase space reconstruction
%         - dim, embedding dimension for phase space reconstruction
% outputs - rho, noise radius
%         - out, an informational array with results of rho and di from the
%                iterative processes
% Remarks
% - This code finds an optimal value of rho for the pseudo periodic
%   surrogation algorithm. It maximizes the number of short sequences in
%   the surrogate that are identical to the original time series.
% - The method in this code first finds rho at a range of values untill a
%   suspected peak is found. A binary search is then performed around the
%   peak untill the percent difference decreases below a threshold.
% Future Work
% - The value rho tends to maximize with a pulse with very small values
%   around it. It is suspected this may cause issues with some time series
%   but it has not been encountered.
% - It's possible the rhoL value of 0.1 may cause issues with pps in
%   certain time series.
% - It's possible a time series may have an optimal value of rho above 0.1
%   but this has not been encountered.

% Version History
% May 2001 - Created by Michael Small
%          - It is believed the original version of this code was written
%            by Michael Small but the source could not be confirmed.
% Jun 2020 - Modifed by Ben Senderling
%          - Removed input handling, all three are necessary. In this
%            version the initial search for the bounds of the binary search
%            was removed completely. It was noticed the optimal rho is
%            frequently ~0.5-0.6. The bounds were replaced with 0.1 and 1 
%            for rhoL and rhoH. This offered a 35% speed improvement over 
%            the previous version when testing an ankle angle, n=10800, 10 
%            times. Added an out variable to use for troubleshooting and
%            diagnostics.
